## 🏆 Tips for High Scores and Distance

1. Keep moving to avoid enemies as the game speeds up
2. **Watch out for palm trees!** They're solid obstacles that damage and bounce you back - plan your route carefully
3. Shoot continuously - there's a short cooldown between shots
4. Focus on enemies at the top of the screen first
5. Use the edges of the screen for strategic positioning, but watch for trees!
6. Don't let enemies pile up - eliminate them quickly!
7. Palm trees scroll down with the beach - use them to judge speed and plan movements
8. The further you travel, the faster everything moves - stay alert!
9. Try to balance survival (avoiding enemies AND obstacles) with scoring (shooting enemies)
